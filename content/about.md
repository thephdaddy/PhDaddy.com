title = "About The PhDaddy"
+++
My name is David Rohrer, and I earned a PhD in psychology in 2015. Instead of doing something traditionally useful with my degree, I mostly just use it to try and love my wife (Lee) and son (Otto) better. Currently, that means I stay at home with my son while my wife earns money and progresses her career. Although I used to think having a sugar mamma was the dream, the reality of staying at home can be really challenging! It is often boring, tiring, and lonely. Despite this, I am grateful for the time with my son, and I feel very proud that I am able to focus so much of my energy on my family. I could not currently imagine doing anything else!

Here are a few pictures of my family. If you decide to waste more time on my site by viewing some blog posts, you will probably see more photos and videos of these jokers!

Also, here is a picture of my phd, because like any reasonable person, you are probably having trouble believing someone with a doctorate could make such low quality internet posts.
